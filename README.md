# Algorithm-Best

The main idea is to solve the Gas station problem.
The problem goes as follows:

First, in order to have a good intuition of the problem, let's imagine a graph with n vertices.
Each vertices is representing a gas station that has a certain amount of fuel.
The vertices are connected to each other such that the graph forms a circle. So for n vertices we have n edges.
On each edge we have a number representing the amount of fuel we need to travel from vertex a to vertex b.

The two main algorithms are "Best" and "Best Round". 
They will be very useful to solve the Gas station problem.
